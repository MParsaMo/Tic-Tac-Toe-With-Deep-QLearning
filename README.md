# Tic-Tac-Toe-With-Deep-QLearning
This project implements an AI-powered Tic Tac Toe game using Deep Q-Learning with Keras. The AI learns optimal gameplay through self-play, using a neural network to estimate Q-values for state-action pairs. You can train the AI, then challenge it as a human player!
